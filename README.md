Hi, I am Nasim Ahmed. I am sharing my experience in teaching and industries, interpersonal skills and ability to work across multiple stakeholders to further the growth of the community and the nation. By profession, I am a teacher, currently working as a faculty at a [private university][1] in Dhaka. My central interests revolve around algorithms, data structures, and computational geometry. I am more into theoretical computer science rather than its applied fields, but I am open to them as well. Besides, I am a trained translator and a certified piano staff notationist. I have a deep interest in non-fiction, and I have written and translated several short stories and poems and composed a few lyrics.
